This program is a simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) application using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI, 
the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech, and PIL (Pillow) to handle images for the app icon and buttons. 
The application allows users to input text, choose a voice (Male or Female), adjust the speech speed (Fast, Normal, Slow),
and either listen to the text or save it as an MP3 file.

Here’s an overview of each component and how they work together:

Components and Workflow
Setting Up the GUI with Tkinter:

A Tkinter Tk() root window is created, with a title, fixed size, and blue background color.
The root window is configured to be non-resizable, with a specific geometry (900x450).
The iconphoto() method sets the app icon from an image (speak.png), and a top frame (top_frame) is created to
 hold the logo and application title.
The main title ("Text to Speech") is displayed on the top_frame, styled in bold Arial font.
Adding a Placeholder to the Text Area:

A Text widget (text_area) is added for the user to input text. It has an initial placeholder text, "Type here," in grey.
Placeholder behavior is achieved by binding FocusIn and FocusOut events to remove_placeholder() and add_placeholder() functions, respectively.
When the user clicks in the text area (FocusIn), the placeholder is removed.
When the user clicks away (FocusOut), the placeholder text reappears if no input has been typed.
Speech Settings Selection (Voice and Speed):

Voice Selection: A Combobox named gender_combobox allows the user to choose between "Female" and "Male" voices.
Speed Selection: Another Combobox, speed_combobox, provides options for "Fast," "Normal," and "Slow" speech speeds.
Both comboboxes are given default values ("Female" for voice and "Normal" for speed) and are placed beside corresponding labels.
Speak Button:

The Speak button uses an image icon (speak.png) and triggers the speaknow() function.
In speaknow(), the selected text is read aloud using pyttsx3. It:
Checks for the placeholder text. If the text area is empty or still has "Type here," it does nothing.
Sets the gender and speed according to the user’s selections and configures the speech engine accordingly.
Finally, engine.runAndWait() is called to start speaking the text aloud.
Save (Download) Button:

The Save button uses an image icon (download.png) and triggers the download() function.
In download():
The function checks if the text area is empty or contains only the placeholder. If so, it calls show_notification("Please type something first before saving") to display a temporary message.
If text is present, it configures the TTS engine to match the selected voice and speed.
After configuring, it prompts the user to choose a folder to save the file, saves the audio file as text.mp3 in the selected location, and calls show_notification() to notify the user that the file has been saved.
Temporary Notification (show_notification function):

This function displays a temporary notification at a specified location (x=550, y=350).
A Label is created to show the message, and it automatically disappears after 3 seconds with root.after(3000, notification_label.destroy).
Images and Icons
Icons and logos are loaded using the PIL library (Image and ImageTk.PhotoImage), which converts image files into formats compatible with Tkinter widgets.

Example Workflow:
The user types or pastes text in the text area.
They select a voice and speed from the dropdown menus.
If they press Speak, the application reads the text aloud using the selected voice and speed.
If they press Save, the application converts the text to an MP3 file and saves it to the chosen directory.
If the text area is empty or only contains the placeholder, a temporary notification appears, prompting the user to type text before saving.
This setup provides a user-friendly interface for performing text-to-speech and saving spoken text as an audio file.
